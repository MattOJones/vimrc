# vimrc
This is my Vim configuration file. It is very much a work in progress, I expect to learn and tweak as I go!

## Installation
You can simply copy the [vim config](https://github.com/MattOJones/vimrc/blob/master/vimrcs/vimconfig.vim)
Or to clone and install execute from your terminal:

    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/MattOJones/vimrc.git ~/.vimfiles
    sh ~/.vimfiles/install_vimrc.sh
